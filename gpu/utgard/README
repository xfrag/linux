ARM Mali-300/400/450 GPU (Utgard)
---------------------------------

BUILD
-----

Make sure you have built the Kernel first (having ran the Kernel's setenv.sh and build.sh)
setenv.sh exposes necessary environment variables for this module's build script.

Having our kernel ready we can just run build.sh. This script will also copy the mali.ko
file to the kernel's modules output.

PACKAGE
-------

Since mali.ko is now with the other kernel modules we can use the kernel's install.sh
script.

INSTALL
-------

# insmod /lib/modules/4.9.113/kernel/drivers/mali.ko

(Instead of using insmod it is possible that a reboot will suffice).
